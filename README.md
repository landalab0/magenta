# MAGENTA 

Branch for the re-structure of the "MAGENTA" main branch.

This first stage only contains the refactor of the 3 original scripts by Erika, useful metadata to start working, and a basic plot function with external libraries.

Additional scripts and functions (Amplicon analysis, more metadata, graphical parsing, etc.) will be added at a future date.

Also, you never run the data_download.sh script, you can use the dummy sequence on /playground if you want to use an example set of sequences.
